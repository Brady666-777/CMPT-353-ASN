# CMPT 371 Assignment - Project Summary

## ✅ Project Complete!

Your client-server networking assignment is now ready with all required components:

### 📁 Project Files Created:

- `tcp_server.py` - TCP server (port 53333)
- `tcp_client.py` - TCP client with RTT measurement
- `udp_server.py` - UDP server (port 53444)
- `udp_client.py` - UDP client with RTT measurement
- `udp_server_53333.py` - UDP server for same-port testing
- `run_tests.py` - Comprehensive automated test suite
- `demo.py` - Interactive demo script
- `run_assignment.ps1` - PowerShell script for easy execution
- `README.md` - Complete documentation

### 🚀 How to Run:

#### Option 1: Complete Automated Testing (Recommended)

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

#### Option 2: PowerShell Script (Windows)

```powershell
.\run_assignment.ps1
```

#### Option 3: Manual Component Testing

1. Start TCP server: `python tcp_server.py`
2. Run TCP client: `python tcp_client.py` (in new terminal)
3. Start UDP server: `python udp_server.py`
4. Run UDP client: `python udp_client.py` (in new terminal)

### 📋 Assignment Coverage:

**Part A (4 marks)** ✅

- TCP communication: "hello TCP" ↔ "back at you TCP"
- UDP communication: "Hello UDP" ↔ "back at you UDP"
- RTT measurement for both protocols
- Source code provided with screenshots capability

**Part B (2 marks)** ✅

- RTT comparison analysis included in code comments
- UDP typically faster due to no connection overhead
- TCP slower due to 3-way handshake and teardown

**Part C (2 marks)** ✅

- 1000 consecutive message testing implemented
- Single reply at the end
- Performance comparison between protocols
- TCP may be faster for bulk due to connection reuse

**Part D (2 marks)** ✅

- Both servers can bind to port 53333 (different protocols)
- TCP client only communicates with TCP server
- UDP server doesn't respond to TCP connections
- Protocol separation demonstration

### 🎯 Key Features:

- ✅ Raw socket programming (no frameworks)
- ✅ Accurate RTT measurement (excludes packet construction time)
- ✅ Proper error handling and cleanup
- ✅ Threading support for concurrent connections
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Clear documentation and analysis

### 📊 Expected Results:

- **UDP RTT**: ~0.5-2ms (faster, no connection overhead)
- **TCP RTT**: ~1-5ms (slower, connection establishment)
- **Bulk TCP**: Better for 1000 messages (connection reuse)
- **Same Port**: Protocols isolated, no cross-communication

### 💡 Next Steps:

1. Run `python run_tests.py` to execute all tests
2. Take screenshots of the output for submission
3. Review the analysis provided in the README.md
4. Submit source code files and screenshots

The project demonstrates all networking concepts required and provides both automated testing and individual component verification capabilities!
