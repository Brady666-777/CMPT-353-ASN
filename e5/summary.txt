Summary of Data Sets

data-1.csv (100 data points):
- x variable: mean = 8.718, std = 12.156, range = [-22.636, 35.237]
- y variable: mean = 12.523, std = 6.640, range = [-2.565, 27.384]
- Correlation coefficient (r) = 0.950
- Description: A dataset with 100 points showing a strong positive linear relationship between x and y variables, with x having a wider spread than y.

data-2.csv (100 data points):
- x variable: mean = -0.711, std = 11.482, range = [-33.271, 27.647]
- y variable: mean = -0.749, std = 6.258, range = [-18.622, 14.147]
- Correlation coefficient (r) = 0.955
- Description: A dataset with 100 points centered around zero showing a very strong positive linear relationship between x and y variables, with both variables having similar negative means.

data-3.csv (300 data points):
- x variable: mean = 0.969, std = 2.236, range = [-2.449, 4.519]
- y variable: mean = 8.509, std = 1.149, range = [6.642, 10.552]
- Correlation coefficient (r) = 0.982
- Description: A dataset with 300 points showing an extremely strong positive linear relationship between x and y variables, with y values consistently higher than x values and smaller variability.

data-4.csv (118 data points):
- x variable: mean = 49.905, std = 28.509, range = [0.000, 87.377]
- y variable: mean = 18.554, std = 16.546, range = [0.000, 44.565]
- Correlation coefficient (r) = -0.081
- Description: A dataset with 118 points showing virtually no linear relationship between x and y variables, with x values typically higher than y values and both variables having wide ranges starting from zero.

data-5.csv (118 data points):
- x variable: mean = 49.910, std = 28.500, range = [4.338, 91.053]
- y variable: mean = 18.556, std = 16.541, range = [0.055, 49.934]
- Correlation coefficient (r) = -0.088
- Description: A dataset with 118 points very similar to data-4.csv, showing no meaningful linear relationship between x and y variables, with x values generally higher than y values.

data-6.csv (100 data points):
- x variable: mean = 7.216, std = 11.922, range = [-24.334, 35.402]
- y variable: mean = 7.602, std = 11.764, range = [-22.956, 36.080]
- Correlation coefficient (r) = 0.935
- Description: A dataset with 100 points showing a strong positive linear relationship between x and y variables, with both variables having similar means, standard deviations, and ranges.
