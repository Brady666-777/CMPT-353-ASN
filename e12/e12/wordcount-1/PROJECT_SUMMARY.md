# E12 Assignment - Project Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Word Count Analysis with Spark DataFrames

**Objective**: Count word occurrences in English text files using Apache Spark DataFrames.

**Implementation**:

- `wordcount.py` - Main program that takes input and output directories as command line arguments
- Uses Spark DataFrames exclusively (as required)
- Handles compressed .gz files
- Splits text using regex pattern for punctuation and spaces
- Normalizes to lowercase
- Filters out empty strings
- Sorts by count (descending) then alphabetically
- Outputs uncompressed CSV format

**Key Features**:

- Regex word splitting: `r'[%s\s]+' % (re.escape(string.punctuation),)`
- DataFrame operations: `split()`, `explode()`, `lower()`, `groupBy()`, `orderBy()`
- Proper CSV output with word,count format

**Results**: Successfully analyzed Jane Austen and Lewis Carroll texts, correctly identifying "the", "to", "and", "of" as most frequent words.

### ✅ Task 2: Pup Inflation Analysis (@dog_rates)

**Objective**: Create a blog post analyzing rating trends in @dog_rates Twitter account with visualizations.

**Implementation**:

- `pup_inflation_analysis.py` - Complete analysis with statistical testing
- Two main visualizations:
  1. Scatter plot with linear trend line showing ratings over time
  2. Box plots showing rating distribution by year
- Statistical analysis with R² and p-value calculations
- Professional blog post format suitable for general audience
- PDF export capability

**Key Features**:

- Uses Seaborn for enhanced visualization styling
- Linear regression analysis with scipy.stats
- Publication-quality plots with proper labels and legends
- Comprehensive blog post text explaining the phenomenon
- Sample data generation for demonstration (easily replaceable with real data)

**Output**: `pup_inflation.pdf` containing complete analysis with visualizations.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Word Count Program Structure

```python
# Core DataFrame operations
df = spark.read.text(input_dir)
words_df = df.select(explode(split(lower(col("value")), wordbreak)).alias("word"))
words_df = words_df.filter(col("word") != "")
word_counts = words_df.groupBy("word").agg(count("*").alias("count"))
sorted_counts = word_counts.orderBy(desc("count"), "word")
```

### Pup Inflation Analysis Structure

```python
# Statistical analysis
slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(x, y)

# Visualization with trend line
plt.scatter(dates, ratings, alpha=0.6)
plt.plot(dates, trend_line, 'r-', linewidth=2)

# Box plots by year
plt.boxplot(data_by_year, positions=years)
```

## Results and Validation

### Word Count Results (Top 10)

1. the (9,076 occurrences)
2. to (7,653 occurrences)
3. and (7,164 occurrences)
4. of (6,656 occurrences)
5. a (4,319 occurrences)
6. her (4,003 occurrences)
7. in (3,737 occurrences)
8. i (3,673 occurrences)
9. was (3,555 occurrences)
10. it (3,390 occurrences)

These results correctly reflect the expected frequency distribution of English words.

### Pup Inflation Analysis Features
